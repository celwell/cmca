        <h1>Who cares?</h1>
    </header> 

<p>Unlike the recent age, historically, humans would commonly ponder important life questions. Just consider the words from one of the most influential philosophers on western thought:</p>

<blockquote>
    Where am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return? ... I am confounded with all these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable condition imaginable, environed with the deepest darkness, and utterly deprived of the use of every member and faculty.
<cite> - David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</cite>
</blockquote>
		
<p>Being human once entailed caring about ideas and where ideas might or might not lead. Now, alternatively, modern humans are drowning themselves endlessly with visual entertainment and the pursuit of self. The result, thinking about essential ideas has been sent to the corner until it can learn to be anti-intellectual and accept illogic without question. From the skeptic to the atheist to the theist, portions of every worldview are guilty of frowning upon proper thought over the basics questions of life with proper tools. Almost no group is exempt from the post modern pattern of trading in the possibility of truth/knowing for subjective, emotional, mental comforts, grounded in experiential highs. All of this is occurring while time marches on and death ends each of us without exception. Or, is death the end?</p>

<p>I believe all humans want to know, but today most humans are hypnotized by dog feed answers to life's most important questions. Most have accepted shallow slogans and canned ideas with little regard to the science of philosophy (i.e. how to think about ideas). Thus, most are told what to think, not how to think. Not skilled enough to think critically, people will accept any old idea as good enough. And that is exactly is happening. Worse, many have thrown the entire enterprise of thinking to the flames claiming true knowledge isn’t even knowable. All is illusory. Yet, how did anyone figure that out if true? Ironically, this is all occurring in the age of scientific discovery and information overload.</p>

<p>For those who stop for a moment and ponder grand ideas, they will typically start with foundational questions. From where or whom did I come? What am I? Where am I going? Each of these questions could invoke a lifetime of thought. Each is certainly worth thinking about. However, only one of these questions is of first order importance. One could get all the answers to all the questions wrong and living a short time with the wrong answers, then die, and that be the end of it. No problem, right? Ignorance and then total death. If death be the end, who cares about ignorance. Temporary pleasure then rules the day, as it should be if death be the end. But what if one lives indefinitely? What if, where we go after death is dependent upon the ideas we hold before death? The ideas we hold fuel how we act today and potentially indefinitely into the future. In short, ideas of consequences. What consequences could ideas have if living goes on after death?</p>

<p>Each of us has a gamble to make. Either, we live on after death or we don’t. One's answer to this pivotal question will influence all other questions and answers. And potentially effect us indefinitely into the future. Thus, you should care about ideas that invoke grand questions and the potential answers. Is the final answer pertaining to physical death that one dies, and that is the complete total end?  Does one have good reason to settle upon this answer and question no more? Or, is it more rational that we have knowledge about being, post death? I assert everyone should care (i.e. think carefully) about these ideas, the circling questions, and the potential answers. Much is at risk, isn't it?' </p>

<p>If we can agree that one has good reason to care about the fundamental philosophical questions of existence due to the potential consequences, we can then begin the process of acquiring the proper thinking tools. If this is done rationally, I believe one will eventually find the truth and simultaneously the truth will find them. Pragmatically we all know the truth is worth caring about.</p>
