        <h1>What is classical monotheistic Christianity?</h1>
        <p>Why defend it (i.e. <a class="wordDef">apologia</a> thus <a class="wordDef">apologetics</a>)?</p>
    </header> 

<p>Before answering the question, “why defend it?”, I need to unpack the words classical and monotheistic to clarify what is being defended and what is not being defended.</p>
		
<p>When I use the term “classical” to refer to Christianity I am referring to the knowledge and beliefs that the early Christians held about Christianity <sup>[1]</sup>. In other words, classical Christianity is what the founders of Christianity held to be true about God and later ratified into a book of <a class="wordDef">scriptures</a>, based on their original knowledge of it <sup>[2]</sup>. The original Christians did not believe Christianity was corrupted. Or needed further revelations, evolutions, or conformity to modern day culture via revisions. Classical Christianity is an unchangeable understanding of God and reality. <a class="wordDef">Mormonism</a>, <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/" class="termDef">Jehovah’s Witness</a>, <a class="wordDef">Atheism</a>, <a class="wordDef">Deism</a>, <a class="wordDef">Islamism</a>, <a class="wordDef">Buddhism</a>, <a class="wordDef">Judaism</a>, and <a class="wordDef">Hinduism</a> do not hold to a classical view of Christianity. At this point I am not arguing that this makes them mistaken. However, I am asserting that none of these competing religions logically hold to the classical monotheistic understanding of Christianity.</p>

<p>I’ve placed the word monotheistic in between the words classical and Christianity to clearly express that what is being defended is the idea of a single (i.e. mono) God that is spaceless, timeless, immaterial, powerful, intelligent, personal and whom created all things (i.e. the greatest possible being).</p>

<p>Why defend classical monotheistic Christianity? Because it is defendable. It is not wishful/blind knowledge or an emotional safety blanket. Classical Christianity is <strong>not</strong> hinged on <a class="termDef">subjective</a> claims, hope in the unknowable, experience driven praying, or irrationality. The fact is that classical Christianity hinges on a single historical event. If Christ did not rise, then Christianity is worthless. Period! This makes classical monotheistic Christianity the only religion of its kind to be testable and ripe for intellectual evaluation and investigation. Additionally, it is a robust and complete explanation of reality unmatched at the table of ideas/worldviews. Now, I just asserted without proof what I am here to argue to be <a class="termDef" data-term="objective">objectively</a> true. For this I must given an answer. Consider this website my answer.</p>
